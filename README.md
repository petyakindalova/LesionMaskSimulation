# Contents overview

The repository containts code for (1) lesion mask simulation, and (2) voxel-wise analysis of binary lesion masks utilising binary-response models (generalised linear models) and obtaining maximum likelihood estimates (ML) and mean bias-reduced estimates (MeanBR). The second step ensures scalability to biobank-scale neuroimaging data sets.
